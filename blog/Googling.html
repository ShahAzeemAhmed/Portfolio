        <p align="center"><b><small>"Do you know how to search on google?" most people would think this question is dumb these days</p></b></small>




            <p>While finding general information is usually straightforward, trying to find something specific can often be overwhelming. Sometimes it's like trying to find a needle in a haystack. You would probably have known about the polite google user,
                the sweet Nan who is putting “Thank you” and “please” in each google search.</p>



            <h3>1. Google Operators“ ” (quotes) </h3>
            <hr>
            <p>Quotes can be used to find the precise search query you want to find. E.g. - “Covid - 19“ will give you these results.</p>
            <img src="Blog Website Images\img\1.png">

            <h3>2. OR</h3>
            <p>This operator can be used among phrases to find relevant results between any of the two terms queried for. E.g - Python OR Ruby gives a result something like this.</p>
            <img src="Blog Website Images\img\2.png">
            <h3>3. (-) minus operator: </h3>
            <p> When searching, certain words don’t apply to the data you're looking for. If there's a specific word that no longer needs to be covered in your search, you may allow Google to recognize it by setting a minus sign (-) in the front of the word.
                E.g. - Best programming language -JAVA gives results like this</p>

            <img src="Blog Website Images\img\3.png">

            <h3>4. (...) Range operator: </h3>
            <hr>


            <p ">You can use '...' to search within a time frame e.g if you wanted to find an article about E-commerce or anything to do with E-commerce 2000...2021.  E.g. - E-commerce 2000...2021 would result like this</p>


                 
            <img src="Blog Website Images\img\4.png ">
                <h3>5. ( * )</h3>
                 
                <p  >keyword to replace missing words.You're looking for something, but did you happen to forget a few words? Don't worry, try * to replace the missing word you forgot.
                    For example, if you want to search for covid19 but only remember `19`, you can use ` * 19` to get the relevant results.</p>

                <h3>6. Define</h3>
                <hr>
                 
              
                    <p  >When looking for a definition of a word, use the define: keyword to find the definition. If you want to find the definition of a blog, `Define: Blogging` will return the results of all articles containing the blog definition.</p>
                    <img src="Blog Website Images\img\6.png ">
                    <h3>7. Use Site:</h3>

                    <p  >Search for a specific website or content.
                        For example, if you want to search for a site that has a blog about Ruby on Rails, search for “ruby on rails site: bluebash.co”</p>

                    <h2>Search Tools</h2>
                    <h3>Google Advanced search</h3>
                    <p >In addition to all of the above operators, you can use
                        <a href="https://www.google.co.in/advanced_search "> Google's advanced search</a>
                        to refine your search results as much as possible.</p>

                 <h3>Google image search</h3>
                 <p>If you want to get to the source of any image or just want the details of the image you google got it cover too using google image search</p>
